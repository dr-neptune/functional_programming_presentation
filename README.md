# Functional Programming in R Presentation

This is a short presentation that I gave at work about functional programming concepts and how we can use them in our R programming.

The presentation was given dynamically using org mode, and then the fpr.pdf version was sent out afterwards.

The Org file pretty prints the code in github, but does not show the images. The pdf file shows the images (which are taken from xkcd comments)
